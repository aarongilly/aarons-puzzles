# aarons-puzzles
A repository supporting my annual puzzle boxes

It was nuked & restarted. I'm taking a new approach on this build so I never have to re-build the puzzles again.

This repo is all build outputs. There is no source code. That's managed elsewhere. Various elsewheres, actually. This keeps them each from breaking & needing updates in the future. 

Aaron's Puzzles is now a static site. My favorite kind.
